# Gold-Rush
Reusing some Blocky Farm components I made I will be creating a short game, Gold Rush! This game will be used as part of one of my university modules. Some new components as well.

I am doing my main source control with PlasticSCM, so the updates in here wont be as frequent. I am planning on uploading the complete project once completed.

**Simplified game idea:**
Collect as many Gold Nuggets as possible during the timer.

**Game description:**
Go to the Gold Blocks while avoiding the obstacles and enemies that try to stop you from collecting as many Gold Nuggets as you would ever want, but hurry, time waits for nobody!
